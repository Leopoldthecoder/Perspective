# Introduction

## What is Perspective.js?
Perspective.js is designed for making dashing parallax scroll effects. Besides the good old parallax scroll, where different layers move in different speeds, it provides a far wider range of effects for you. To have an idea of what Perspective.js can do, check out this [example](https://perspective.js.org/examples/).

More than that, parallax tilt hover is also supported.

## Features
