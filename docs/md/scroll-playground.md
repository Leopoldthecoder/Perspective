# Playground

With all the configurations we picked up in the last section in mind, let's try them ourselves on the [playground](https://jsfiddle.net/leopoldthecuber/hkfprgrh/embed/result/). I've moved the first [example](https://perspective.js.org/examples/) (not including the SVG animation stage because animating SVGs needs tons of `items` and it takes too much space) to jsfiddle where you can modify its configurations and see how they make animations different.
