# HTML 结构
For Perspective.js to work properly, there are some restrictions regarding HTML structure. But don't worry, because the required HTML structure is pretty intuitive.

- All stages should be wrapped inside a container, and it's strongly recommended that the size of each stage be equal to that of the container
- All stages should be a direct child of the container, meaning they are siblings to each other
- All stages should stay in the normal flow, so they cannot be absolutely positioned nor fixed

That's pretty much all you should remember when writing your HTML.
